Welcome to the Primed Data Processing documentation.
====================================================
**primed_data_processing** is a Python package for processing data created
at the UVic PRIMED Battery Lab https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/primed/.
The intent is that this package will greatly improve access to the data and improve
its ease of implementation in battery and grid modelling efforts.
